# peep-admin
This is being developed for use on a Exchange 2010 server to notify SysSecAdmins when a mailbox is accessed with admin privileges. This is a PowerShell project
# usage
This is an auditing/forensics tool in the basic sense. This is being developed out of the need to be able to be notified when a mailbox is accessed with administrator privileges and where and who was responsible, and for what. 

There shouldnâ€™t be any specific needs from the user aside from basic server configuration, along with initial program configuration.
This program is being developed for a single specific server instance and may need additional adjustments before working with your current implementation of your server.

# flow
The general idea I have at this time-

will probably be set up to run on a specific time frame to allow for constant updates/a scheduled event

A Powershell script to retrieve the audit log history of a exchange server and save the output in a file in a safe folder.

Search-AdminAuditLog -Cmdlets

-LogonTypes

Save/or initiate notification to required auditor for further inspection
