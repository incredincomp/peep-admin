# peep-admin
This is being developed for use on a Exchange 2010 server to notify SysSecAdmins when a mailbox is accessed with admin privileges. This was started as a simple PowerShell project on 1/11/19 by ~incredincomp

I am currently bumped up agaisnt a debugging wall and if you have any experience running this in your enviroment, please let me know how it went. 

# usage
This is an auditing/forensics tool in the basic sense. This is being developed out of the need to be able to be notified when a mailbox is accessed with administrator privileges and where and who was responsible, and for what. 

There shouldnâ€™t be any specific needs from the user aside from basic server configuration, along with initial program configuration.

This program is being developed for a single specific server instance and may need additional adjustments before working with your current implementation of your server.

# flow notes
The general idea I have at this time-

Generate a GUI window with visual studio WPF to select configuration options for specific cmdlets to search for and maybe what mailboxs to search 

will probably be set up to run on a specific time frame to allow for constant updates/a scheduled event with windows event manager

A Powershell script to retrieve the audit log history of a exchange server and save it to an array item for future callback in a notification when certain paramaters are met.

initiate notification to required auditor for further inspection 


included in notification:

cmdlet origination IP

cmdlet Origin USER name or ID 

MAILBOX viewed

TIME and DATE of incident
